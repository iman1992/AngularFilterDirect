Explain how Java programs can be divided into smaller parts.

Java programs can be divided into smaller parts through the use of many different classes, packages and the like. Superclasses and subclasses, dividing functionality into different classes, etc.

Explain how Angular applications can be divided up into smaller parts.

Primarily through the use of factories, controllers and SPA, as well as directives. Having a separate controller for each partial makes the functionality very modular, and having information passing through factories makes them even more modular.

Explain the purpose of Angular topics like: Controllers, Services, Directives and Filters.

Controllers carry the functionality for carrying out tasks in the given partial. They're the ones sending and receiving calls from the HTML. Directives can be used when there's specific partials or such that you want to be able to insert quickly and easily as a single tag. Filters are useful for filtering, such as dates or currencies, though if you have special needs you can make your own custom filters. Services carry some of the same functionality as a factory, basically being a way in which you can create an injectable object. Services must however always be instantiated as objects, whereas factories can be objects, functions, or just any value. Services will provide an instance of a function, factories will provide the values returned by the factory's invoker.
